Check gridapi logs for errors\n2. Verify sessionInterceptor is registered in serve.go\n3. Verify session cookie is sent (DevTools → Application → Cookies)\n4. Check ResolvePrincipal implementation (grid-3fbc)\n\n### If tests fail:\n1. Check compilation errors first: `make build`\n2. Verify database migrations: `make db-migrate`\n3.

JWT Verifier (auth/jwt.go:NewVerifier) extracts token and sets CLAIMS in context\\n2. Authn Middleware (middleware/authn.go:NewAuthnMiddleware) reads claims and sets PRINCIPAL in context\\n3. Claims are stored via PRIVATE context keys (not exposed to other packages)\\n\\n### Pattern Mismatch Discovered\\n\\nSession cookies are opaque tokens (not self-contained JWTs). The architecture assumes:\\n- Authentication tokens are JWTs with embedded claims\\n- Token validation via cryptographic signature\\n- Claims extraction happens in verifier layer\\n\\nSession cookies require:\\n- Database lookup to validate\\n- Loading user/service account to get subject\\n- No embedded claims to extract\\n\\n**Problem:** Implementing \"parallel paths\" would require duplicating all the principal resolution logic from authn.go (JIT provisioning, role aggregation, Casbin grouping, etc.)\\n\\n### Options Evaluated\\n\\n**Option 1: Parallel Authentication Paths**\\n- Session middleware sets principal directly\\n- Duplicates 200+ lines of authn logic\\n- Clean separation but high maintenance cost\\n- ❌ Rejected due to code duplication\\n\\n**Option 2: Extend JWT Verifier to Support Cookies**\\n- Modify auth/jwt.go to handle both tokens and cookies\\n- Verifier becomes dependent on SessionRepository\\n- Mixes cryptographic verification with database lookups\\n- ❌ Rejected due to separation of concerns violation\\n\\n**Option 3: Session-to-Claims Adapter (SELECTED)**\\n- Session middleware converts cookie → synthetic JWT claims\\n- Reuses entire authn middleware logic path\\n- Requires exposing SetClaimsContext() and SetTokenHashContext() helpers\\n- Creates \"fake JWT claims\" but functionally correct\\n- ✅ Minimal changes, no duplication, pragmatic trade-off\\n\\n**Option 4: Dedicated Session Validator in Authn Middleware**\\n- Authn middleware checks cookie before JWT claims\\n- Still duplicates principal resolution logic\\n- ❌ Rejected due to dual responsibility and duplication\\n\\n### Selected Implementation: Option 3\\n\\n**Architecture:**\\n\\n\\n**Trade-off Accepted:**\\n- Synthetic JWT claims are \"philosophically impure\" (not real JWTs)\\n- BUT: Pragmatic, reuses all existing logic, minimal code changes\\n- Pattern: Adapter - converts session cookie to JWT-compatible claims\\n\\n### Implementation Changes Required\\n\\n**File 1: cmd/gridapi/internal/auth/jwt.go**\\nAdd two helper functions to expose context setters:\\n\\n\\n**File 2: cmd/gridapi/internal/middleware/session.go**\\nAlready implemented correctly:\\n- ✅ NewSessionAuthMiddleware() creates synthetic claims\\n- ✅ Calls SetClaimsContext() and SetTokenHashContext()\\n- ✅ Validates session (expired, revoked, disabled account)\\n- ⚠️ Uses custom shouldSkipSessionAuth() instead of auth.defaultSkipper (minor)\\n\\n**File 3: cmd/gridapi/cmd/serve.go:115**\\nFix function name:\\n- Current:  ❌\\n- Correct:  ✅\\n\\n**File 4: cmd/gridapi/internal/server/auth_handlers.go:160**\\nAlready fixed:\\n- ✅ ClientID field now populated for internal-idp mode\\n\\n### Testing Impact\\n\\nIntegration tests (tests/integration/auth_mode2_test.go) are failing because:\\n1. Missing SetClaimsContext() function causes compilation error\\n2. Missing SetTokenHashContext() function causes compilation error\\n3.

Connect handlers run with a separate context that requires Connect-specific interceptors.\n\n## Solution\nCreate NewAuthnInterceptor() following the Connect interceptor pattern:\n\n1. Extract grid.session cookie from Connect request metadata/headers\n2. Validate session using SessionRepository (reuse session.go logic)\n3. Create synthetic JWT claims (same pattern as session.go lines 72-89)\n4. Set claims in context via auth.SetClaimsContext()\n5. Let existing authn middleware resolve principal from claims\n6.

The context from chi middleware is not automatically propagated.\n\n**Solution Pattern (from grid-74bc):**\nSession middleware uses \"session-to-claims adapter\" pattern:\n1. Cookie → session lookup → user/roles\n2. Create synthetic JWT claims (same structure as real JWTs)\n3. Set via auth.SetClaimsContext() and auth.SetTokenHashContext()\n4. Authn middleware reads claims, resolves principal\n\nThis interceptor must:\n1. Extract cookie from Connect request (not HTTP request)\n2. Replicate session validation from session.go\n3.

This was a temporary workaround to avoid import cycles during refactoring, but now provides no compile-time safety.\n\n## Solution\nCreate a compile-time contract interface in internal/server that proves iam.Service satisfies all required methods at build time.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Create IAM contract interface** (cmd/gridapi/internal/server/iam_contract.go)\n   - Define `type iamAdminService interface` with all IAM methods used by handlers\n   - Add compile-time assertion: `var _ iamAdminService = (iam.Service)(nil)`\n   - Methods to include: CreateServiceAccount, ListServiceAccounts, RevokeServiceAccount, RotateServiceAccountSecret, AssignUserRole, RemoveUserRole, AssignGroupRole, RemoveGroupRole, GetRoleByName, GetRoleByID, GetUserBySubject, GetUserByID, GetServiceAccountByClientID, GetServiceAccountByID, ListGroupRoles, GetPrincipalRoles, GetRolePermissions, ListAllRoles, CreateRole, UpdateRole, DeleteRole, ListUserSessions, RevokeSession, CreateSession, GetSessionByID, RefreshGroupRoleCache\n\n2. **Update router types** (cmd/gridapi/internal/server/router.go)\n   - Change `RouterOptions.IAMService interface{}` → `IAMService iamAdminService`\n   - Remove runtime casting logic (lines 133-169)\n\n3. **Update handler types** (cmd/gridapi/internal/server/connect_handlers.go)\n   - Change `StateServiceHandler.iamService interface{}` → `iamService iamAdminService`\n   - Update `WithIAMService` helper signature\n\n4. **Remove all type assertions** (cmd/gridapi/internal/server/connect_handlers_auth.go)\n   - Delete all `iamSvc, ok := h.iamService.(interface { ... })` blocks\n   - Replace with simple nil check: `if h.iamService == nil { return error }`\n   - Call methods directly on `h.iamService` (compile-time verified)\n   - Affects: CreateServiceAccount, ListServiceAccounts, RevokeServiceAccount, RotateServiceAccount, AssignRole, RemoveRole, AssignGroupRole, RemoveGroupRole, ListGroupRoles, GetEffectivePermissions, ListRoles, CreateRole, UpdateRole, DeleteRole, ListSessions, RevokeSession, roleToProto\n\n5. **Update serve.go wiring** (cmd/gridapi/cmd/serve.go)\n   - Simplify IAMService assignment (line 188) - no casting needed\n   - Router already receives concrete iam.Service\n\n6. **Add layering enforcement** (optional)\n   - Add staticcheck rule or go:generate directive\n   - Prevent future repository imports in internal/server\n   - Reference: cmd/gridapi/layering-action-plan.md (lines 152-156)\n\n## Success Criteria\n- Zero runtime type assertions in handlers\n- Compile error if iam.Service missing required method\n- Code compiles successfully\n- All IAM unit tests still pass\n- Router properly typed with iamAdminService\n\n## Benefits\n- Compile-time safety (catch missing methods at build time)\n- Better IDE autocomplete and refactoring support\n- No runtime panics from failed assertions\n- Cleaner handler code (no repetitive assertion blocks)\n- Enforces layering rule via compiler","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-13T09:30:08.598609+07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-13T11:03:02.629179+07:00","closed_at":"2025-11-13T11:03:02.629179+07:00","labels":["component:gridapi","phase:6g-type-safety","spec:007-webapp-auth"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"grid-bedc","depends_on_id":"grid-ff82","type":"blocks","created_at":"2025-11-13T09:30:08.600618+07:00","created_by":"daemon"}],"comments":[{"id":73,"issue_id":"grid-bedc","author":"vincentdesmet","text":"Phase 6G improves compile-time type safety by replacing fragile runtime type assertions with a proper contract interface.

This provides true black-box testing of the user-facing authentication experience that cannot be tested with integration tests.\n\n## Background\n\nIntegration tests verify backend contracts (JWT validation, session management, Connect RPC authentication) but cannot test the full browser-based SSO flow:\n- OAuth2 authorization code flow with browser redirects\n- /auth/sso/login → Keycloak → /auth/callback\n- Session cookie creation and browser cookie handling\n- Webapp UI interaction with authenticated sessions\n\nA previous integration test attempted to test this using database insertion hacks, but was removed as it bypassed the real OAuth2 flow (see grid-c1cd comments, 2025-11-16).\n\n## Technology Choice\n\nUsing Playwright with TypeScript (not Go):\n- Playwright does not officially support Go\n- Webapp is Vite/React TypeScript, so TypeScript tests are more natural\n- Playwright TypeScript has better tooling and documentation\n- Infrastructure already initialized: tests/e2e/, playwright.config.ts\n\n## Design Reference\n\nSee specs/007-webapp-auth/TESTING.md lines 32-100 for complete design:\n- Guiding principles (true black-box, user-centric scenarios)\n- Test suite structure\n- Test cases to implement\n\n## Scope\n\n### 1.

Helper Functions (child task)  \n- login(page, username, password) - Handle SSO redirect flow with Keycloak\n- logout(page) - Click logout, verify redirect to login\n- createState(page, logicId, labels) - Use webapp UI to create state\n- navigateToDashboard(page) - Navigate and wait for load\n- waitForAuthRedirect(page) - Handle Keycloak redirects\n\n### 3. Core Test Cases (4 child tasks)\n\n**TestE2E_SuccessfulLoginAndSessionPersistence** (TESTING.md:63-72)\n- Navigate to webapp → click login → Keycloak auth → verify dashboard\n- Reload page → verify session persists\n\n**TestE2E_GroupBasedPermission_Success** (TESTING.md:74-82)  \n- Login as user in product-engineers group\n- Create state with env:dev label via UI → verify success\n- Verify state appears in dashboard list\n\n**TestE2E_GroupBasedPermission_Forbidden** (TESTING.md:84-92)\n- Login as user in product-engineers group  \n- Attempt to create state with env:prod label → verify error message\n\n**TestE2E_FirstTimeLogin_JIT_Provisioning** (TESTING.md:94-100)\n- Login as user who exists in Keycloak but not in Grid database\n- Verify successful authentication and dashboard access\n- Proves JIT provisioning in /auth/sso/callback works\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- All 4 E2E test cases implemented and passing\n- Tests run against full docker-compose environment (gridapi + webapp + Keycloak + PostgreSQL)\n- No reliance on internal implementation details (true black-box)\n- Tests are repeatable and can run in CI\n- Documentation updated in tests/e2e/README.md\n\n## Non-Goals\n\n- This does NOT replace integration tests (those test backend contracts)\n- This does NOT test Mode 2 (internal IdP) flows (covered by integration tests)\n- This focuses on Mode 1 (external IdP/SSO) user workflows only\n\n## References\n\n- Design: specs/007-webapp-auth/TESTING.md lines 32-100\n- Integration test gap: specs/007-webapp-auth/tasks.md lines 371-405\n- Removed brittle test: grid-c1cd comments (2025-11-16)\n- Related parent issue: grid-5c57 (integration test coverage)\n- Playwright docs: https://playwright.dev/\n\n## Estimated Effort\n\n- Infrastructure setup: 2-3 hours (partially complete)\n- Helper functions: 3-4 hours  \n- Test case implementation: 2-3 hours per test case (8-12 hours total)\n- Total: 13-19 hours\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Docker compose environment (already exists)\n- Keycloak with test users (already configured)\n- Webapp running (npm run dev or docker)\n- Playwright initialized (already done)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-11-16T12:27:07.522614+07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-16T12:27:07.522614+07:00","labels":["component:webapp","phase:e2e","spec:007-webapp-auth","type:test"]}

Add Global Setup/Teardown\n\nCreate `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts`:\n```typescript\nimport { chromium, FullConfig } from '@playwright/test';\n\nasync function globalSetup(config: FullConfig) {\n  console.log('🚀 E2E Global Setup');\n  \n  // Wait for services to be ready\n  await waitForService(GRID_CONFIG.gridAPIURL);\n  await waitForService(GRID_CONFIG.keycloakURL);\n  await waitForService(GRID_CONFIG.webappURL);\n  \n  console.log('✅ All services ready');\n}\n\nexport default globalSetup;\n```\n\n### 4. Update README.md\n\nUpdate `tests/e2e/README.md` with:\n- How to run tests against docker-compose\n- Environment variable configuration\n- Test user credentials\n- Troubleshooting guide\n\n### 5. Add npm Scripts\n\nUpdate root `package.json`:\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test:e2e\": \"playwright test\",\n    \"test:e2e:ui\": \"playwright test --ui\",\n    \"test:e2e:debug\": \"playwright test --debug\",\n    \"test:e2e:headed\": \"playwright test --headed\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- Playwright configured to test against http://localhost:5173 (webapp)\n- Test fixtures defined for Keycloak users\n- Global setup waits for all services (gridapi, webapp, Keycloak)\n- README documents how to run tests\n- Can run: `pnpm test:e2e` successfully (even with just example.spec.ts)\n\n## Testing\n\n```bash\n# Start environment\ndocker-compose up -d\ncd webapp \u0026\u0026 npm run dev \u0026\n\n# Run tests\npnpm test:e2e\n\n# Should see Playwright launch browser and run tests\n```\n\n## References\n\n- Playwright config: https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration\n- Docker integration: https://playwright.dev/docs/docker","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-16T12:29:05.518628+07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-16T12:29:05.518628+07:00","labels":["component:webapp","phase:e2e","spec:007-webapp-auth","type:test"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"grid-f218.1","depends_on_id":"grid-f218","type":"parent-child","created_at":"2025-11-16T18:24:33.237106+07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

This should be refactored to filter results based on state labels and user permissions, similar to how state-output:list will work.","design":"Current Implementation Problem:\nThe ListStates RPC uses a global, unconditional state:list permission. The interceptor performs an authorization check with empty labels (map[]), which means users can list ALL states regardless of their label-based permissions (e.g., env=dev restriction).\n\nThis is a temporary workaround. The proper fix requires one of two approaches:\n\nApproach 1 - Post-Filter in Service Layer:\n- Keep global state:list permission in interceptor\n- In the service layer, load all states, then filter based on user's permissions\n- For each state, check if user has state:read with that state's labels\n- Only return states the user is authorized to read\n\nApproach 2 - Pre-Filter with Label Query:\n- Interceptor extracts user's effective permissions\n- Determines which label combinations are allowed (e.g., env=dev)\n- Service layer queries database with WHERE clause matching allowed labels\n- This is more efficient but requires parsing Casbin policies to build the query\n\nRecommendation: Start with Approach 1 for correctness, optimize later if needed.\n\nNote: This same pattern will apply to other list operations (ListDependencies, etc.)","acceptance_criteria":"- ListStates only returns states the user is authorized to read\n- product-engineer with env=dev only sees dev states, not prod states\n- Integration test verifies filtering works correctly\n- Performance is acceptable for typical state counts (\u0026lt;1000 states)","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"chore","created_at":"2025-10-28T12:13:27.739195+07:00","updated_at":"2025-11-04T12:05:27.013409+07:00","labels":["component:gridapi","phase:us4","spec:007-webapp-auth","story:US4"],"dependencies":[{"issue_id":"grid-f5947b22","depends_on_id":"grid-32ef","type":"discovered-from","created_at":"2025-11-16T18:00:20.125204+07:00","created_by":"daemon"}]}

Without authn interceptors, all Connect RPC requests return 401 because no principal is set in context.\n\n## Solution\nRegister NewSessionInterceptor and NewJWTInterceptor in serve.go BEFORE authz interceptor.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### File: cmd/gridapi/cmd/serve.go\n\nLocate the Connect interceptor registration section (around line 135-140, after authz interceptor creation).\n\n**Before:**\n```go\n// Create authz interceptor\nauthzInterceptor := gridmiddleware.NewAuthzInterceptor(cfg, authzDeps)\n\n// Register interceptors\nconnectInterceptors := []connect.Interceptor{\n    authzInterceptor,  // ❌ WRONG: Authz runs first, no principal set\n}\n```\n\n**After:**\n```go\n// Create authn interceptors\nsessionInterceptor := gridmiddleware.NewSessionInterceptor(cfg, authnDeps)\njwtInterceptor := gridmiddleware.NewJWTInterceptor(cfg, authnDeps)\n\n// Create authz interceptor\nauthzInterceptor := gridmiddleware.NewAuthzInterceptor(cfg, authzDeps)\n\n// Register interceptors IN ORDER (authn before authz)\nconnectInterceptors := []connect.Interceptor{\n    sessionInterceptor,  // ✅ Try session cookie first (webapp)\n    jwtInterceptor,      // ✅ Try JWT bearer second (CLI)\n    authzInterceptor,    // ✅ Enforce permissions last (all clients)\n}\n```\n\n## Critical: Interceptor Ordering\n\nOrder matters! Interceptors run in the order they are registered:\n\n1. **SessionInterceptor** (first):\n   - Checks for `grid.session` cookie\n   - If found: validates session, sets principal\n   - If not found: skips, calls next\n\n2. **JWTInterceptor** (second):\n   - Checks for `Authorization: Bearer` header\n   - If found AND no principal set: validates JWT, sets principal\n   - If not found OR principal already set: skips, calls next\n\n3. **AuthzInterceptor** (last):\n   - Checks if principal is set in context\n   - If not set: returns 401 Unauthenticated\n   - If set: enforces Casbin policies, returns 403 if denied\n\n## Testing Context\n\nAfter this change:\n- **Webapp (session cookie)**: SessionInterceptor sets principal → authz checks permissions → RPC succeeds\n- **CLI (JWT bearer)**: JWTInterceptor sets principal → authz checks permissions → RPC succeeds\n- **Unauthenticated**: No interceptor sets principal → authz returns 401\n- **Unauthorized**: Principal set but lacks permission → authz returns 403\n\n## Files Modified\n- cmd/gridapi/cmd/serve.go (interceptor registration section)\n\n## Dependencies\n- REQUIRES: grid-3fbc (ResolvePrincipal refactor)\n- REQUIRES: grid-d2b5 (session interceptor implementation)\n- REQUIRES: grid-2319 (JWT interceptor implementation)\n- BLOCKS: Testing tasks\n\n## Manual Verification\n\nAfter change, code should compile:\n```bash\ncd cmd/gridapi \u0026\u0026 go build -o ../../bin/gridapi .\n```\n\nIf compilation fails, check:\n1. Import statement: `gridmiddleware \"cmd/gridapi/internal/middleware\"`\n2. Function signatures match interceptor implementations\n3. AuthnDependencies struct has all required fields\n\n## Constitution IX Justification\nConfiguration change - no layering concerns.
